# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

# Introduction about myself
My name is yilin Li, this is my code about [my github](https://github.com/Liyilin66/CP1404pratical)


## Reflection about this lecture

* I learnt the basics of python and what all the symbols mean.
* This subject has made my maths and logical thinking much clearer
* I've always been sloppy when writing code, which leads to major and minor problems with the output.
